Database technologies are used to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently in software applications. They are mainly divided into SQL databases (like MySQL and PostgreSQL), which use structured tables, and NoSQL databases (like MongoDB and Cassandra), which handle flexible and large-scale data. Key concepts include indexing, transactions, replication, and cloud services such as AWS RDS and MongoDB Atlas. Together, these technologies ensure data is organized, secure, and quickly accessible.
