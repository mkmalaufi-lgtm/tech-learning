Backend technologies power the hidden part of a web application that users don't see. They handle server-side logic, database operations, authentication, security, and communication with the frontend. Common backend languages include Node.js, Python, Java, PHP, and C#, supported by databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. Backend systems use APIs (REST, GraphQL), servers (Nginx, Apache), and cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) to ensure the application runs smoothly, securely, and efficiently.
